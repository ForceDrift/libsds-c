###  Data Structures in C

This an implementation of some common data structures in C. I made this as an exercise when learning memory managment in C and so use it at your own will. 


This library includes the implementations of the following data structures and their core operations and algorithms  
 * Vector (auto-expanding array)
 * Linked List
 * Queue (primairly for breadth-first-search)
 * Binary Search Tree
 * Directed Graphs
